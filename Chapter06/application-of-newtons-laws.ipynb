        "(a) A piano is lifted by a crane. The original scene is redrawn in a deliberately simplified form to emphasize the essential geometry. (b) With the simplified sketch, the relevant forces are easily identified: the rope tension $\\vec{T}$, the force exerted by the piano on the rope $\\vec{F}_T$, and the weight of the piano $\\vec{w}$. (c) Defining the piano as the system of interest removes $\\vec{F}_T$, which acts on the outside world, leaving only $\\vec{T}$ and $\\vec{w}$ in the free-body diagram (FBD). (d) When the piano is stationary, these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so $\\vec{T} = -\\vec{w}$.
