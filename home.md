# Welcome to Introductory Physics

This Jupyter Book contains the course notes, worked examples, and computational exercises for **PHYS 2425: University Physics** at East Texas A&M University.

These notes are designed to help you **learn physics by doing physics**. Instead of reading long explanations and memorizing formulas, you will work through structured problems, explain your reasoning in words, and verify results using simple Python code.

## How to use this book

Each chapter is organized around **worked examples and exercises**, not just text.

Most problems follow the same structure:
- **The Problem**: what is being asked
- **The Model**: how we think about the physics
- **The Math**: the solution written step by step in sentences
- **The Conclusion**: what the result means physically
- **The Verification**: a short Python calculation or plot to check the answer

This structure is intentional. It mirrors how you are expected to think and write on homework and exams.

## Interacting with the content

Many sections are written as Jupyter notebooks. You can:
- Run the code cells
- Modify parameters and rerun them
- Use the plots to visualize motion
- Open the notebooks in **Google Colab** using the rocket icon at the top of the page

Python is used as a **verification and visualization tool**, not as a replacement for analytical problem solving.

## Background expectations

You are not expected to be an expert in calculus or programming.
- Calculus ideas are introduced only when needed and always in context
- Python examples are typically short and heavily commented
- The focus is on understanding the physics, not technical tricks

If you are taking Calculus at the same time, that is completely fine.

## A living document

This book is actively evolving. Content may be refined, expanded, or reorganized during the semester based on what helps students learn most effectively.

If something feels unclear, that is useful feedback.

## Start here

If this is your first time using the book:
1. Read **Who Are These Notes For?**
2. Skim the **Course FAQ**
3. Open the first chapter and try running the verification code

Physics makes more sense once you see it move.
