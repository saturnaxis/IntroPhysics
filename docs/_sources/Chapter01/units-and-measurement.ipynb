        "Physics problems are not solved by memorizing formulas. They are solved by building a **model**, applying **mathematics consistently**, interpreting the **result**, and checking the work. Throughout this book, worked examples and exercises follow a common structure to reinforce this process.\n",

        "### The Model (Strategy)\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step in solving any physics problem is to decide **how to represent the physical situation**. This involves identifying the relevant physical quantities, assumptions, and relationships before writing down equations.\n",
        "\n",
        "A useful strategy is to ask:\n",
        "\n",
        "- What physical quantities are involved?\n",
        "- What is known and what is unknown?\n",
        "- What simplifying assumptions are reasonable?\n",
        "- What definitions, principles, or laws apply?\n",

        "\n",
        "Once a model has been established, the next step is to translate it into mathematics.\n",

        "This typically involves:\n",
        "- writing equations using symbols rather than numbers,\n",
        "- applying definitions or relationships consistently,\n",
