    "# Who Are These Notes For?\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Book is intended to be useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Undergraduate students taking an *introductory* course in astronomy or physics\n",
    "- Students who are new to scientific computing but curious about how computation supports physical reasoning\n",
    "- Anyone with some background in astronomy or physics who is interested in a structured, interactive presentation of the material\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes are written with the assumption that **curiosity and effort matter more than prior experience**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What These Notes Are (and Are Not)\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is **not** a traditional textbook. It is not meant to be read passively from start to finish, and it is not a collection of formulas to memorize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, it is designed as:\n",
    "- a **guided companion** to lecture and discussion,\n",
    "- a place to see how physical ideas are *modeled mathematically*,\n",
    "- and a space to **check, explore, and verify** ideas using computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to help you develop confidence in *thinking like a scientist*, not just in producing answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interacting with the Book\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sections of the book include **Python code cells** embedded in Jupyter notebooks. These are used primarily for:\n",
    "- verifying analytical results,\n",
    "- visualizing physical behavior,\n",
    "- and checking assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do **not** need prior experience with Python to use this book effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter can be opened using [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) via the rocket icon at the top of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/saturnaxis/ModernAstro/blob/main/Preamble/Figure_1.jpg?raw=true?\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Launch Colab** button available at the top of each page.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Google Colab environment already includes common scientific packages such as:\n",
    "- `numpy`\n",
    "- `scipy`\n",
    "- `pandas`\n",
    "- `matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to:\n",
    "- run code cells,\n",
    "- modify values,\n",
    "- break things,\n",
    "- and see what changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning happens when you experiment.\n",

    "## How to Read Worked Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Most worked examples in this book follow a consistent structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Problem** — what is being asked\n",
    "- **The Model** — how we represent the physical situation\n",
    "- **The Math** — the analytical steps\n",
    "- **The Conclusion** — the final result and its interpretation\n",
    "- **The Verification** — a numerical or computational check\n",
    "\n",
    "When studying an example:\n",
    "- Read the *Model* before the math.\n",
    "- Try to predict the result before reading the solution.\n",
    "- Use the verification step to confirm your reasoning, not replace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Computation and Exams\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is used in this book as a **learning and verification tool**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On exams:\n",
    "- You will be provided with **lookup tables**, not code.\n",
    "- You are expected to understand **units, dimensions, and physical reasoning**, not Python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of computation here is to help you:\n",
    "- build intuition,\n",
    "- catch mistakes,\n",
    "- and connect abstract equations to real quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloning and Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "All source material for this book is publicly available on GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "[saturnaxis/IntroPhysics](https://github.com/saturnaxis/IntroPhysics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the book is open source, you are welcome to:\n",
    "- clone it for your own use,\n",
    "- suggest improvements,\n",
    "- or adapt portions for other courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is intended to be a **living document** that evolves with feedback, refinement, and continued use.\n"
