# Course FAQ

##  What will class actually look like?

Most class days are **not full-on lectures**. You’ll work in **groups of four** on structured problems during class. These problems are designed to look like homework and exams, so class time is where you practice doing the hard part, with help.

##  What does a “complete” solution look like?

Every problem you submit should include:

1. A short **problem restatement**
2. A brief **strategy** (what ideas you’re using and why)
3. The **math**, written in sentences—not just equations
4. A **conclusion** explaining what the answer means physically
5. A small **Python check** (a calculation or a plot)

You’ll have a notebook template to follow.

##  Why do we have to use Python?

Python is just a **verification tool**.
You still have to solve the problem analytically first. Python is used to:

* check your math
* visualize the motion
* confirm that the answer makes sense

Simple code is totally fine, where this is not a programming course.

##  I’m taking calculus at the same time. Is that a problem?

No. We’ll use calculus in a **very limited, practical way**:

* derivatives as “rates of change”
* basic polynomial integrals (power rule only)

When calculus shows up, we’ll connect it directly to the physics. If you want more detail, I’ll link to OpenStax Calculus.

##  Can I work with other students?

Yes and you should.

* **In class**: group work is required
* **Homework**: you can talk through ideas, but your writing and code must be your own

Copy-and-paste solutions (from classmates or AI) get **zero credit**.

##  Can I use AI tools?

Limited use is allowed.

* OK: syntax help, debugging, quick clarification
* Not OK: generating full solutions, explanations, or write-ups

If you use AI, **say so** in your notebook. Undocumented use counts as academic dishonesty.

##  How are grades weighted?

* Discussions: **10%**
* Participation & labs: **15%**
* Homework: **15%**
* Exams (4 total): **60%**

The optional final exam can replace your lowest exam score.

##  What if I start falling behind?

Start small and start early.

* Work a little every week
* Ask questions before deadlines
* Use office hours, Slack, and your group

This course rewards **steady effort**, not cramming the night before.
