Although forces act on the car, they balance in both the vertical and horizontal directions, producing zero net force. With zero net force, the car does not accelerate and continues moving with constant velocity.\n",

        "\n",
        "The magnitude of the thrust is extremely large compared to everyday forces, reflecting the extreme accelerations involved in rocket-sled experiments. An acceleration of $49\\ \\text{m/s}^2$ corresponds to about $5g$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Historical rocket-sled tests reached even larger accelerations, on the order of tens of $g$, to study human tolerance to rapid acceleration and deceleration.\n",
        "\n",
        "This example illustrates several key ideas of Newton's second law. First, forces acting in the same direction add, while opposing forces subtract. Second, choosing the correct system is essential: the thrust forces are external to the sled-rocket-rider system, while internal forces between components of the system do not appear. Finally, Newton's second law provides a direct and quantitative link between force, mass, and acceleration, allowing us to predict the performance of real physical systems.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Verification**\n",
        "\n",
        "We verify the result numerically by recomputing the total thrust required from Newton's second law and then dividing by four to obtain the thrust of each rocket.\n",
