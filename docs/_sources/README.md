# Introductory Physics (PHYS 2425)

This repository contains the **JupyterBook lecture notes and computational exercises** for **PHYS 2425: University Physics I** at [East Texas A&M University](https://www.etamu.edu/physics/).

The book is designed as a **structured, interactive companion** to the course rather than a traditional textbook. It blends:

- Conceptual explanations and worked examples
- Dimensional analysis and unit reasoning
- Python-based verification and computation
- In-class group problems and homework scaffolding

The primary conceptual framework is based on [OpenStax: *University Physics Volume 1*](https://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/preface), but the presentation, examples, and exercises have been **substantially reorganized and rewritten** to emphasize:
- physical modeling,
- careful treatment of units and dimensions,
- and reproducible computational workflows.

## How to Use This Book

### For students
- Read sections **before or after lecture** to reinforce core ideas.
- Work through examples line by line; most include **Python verification cells**.
- Use the notebooks as a reference when preparing homework and exams.
- Import notebooks into tools such as [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) or Jupyter to create personalized study guides.

### For instructors
- The material is modular and can be adapted for:
  - traditional lecture courses,
  - studio or hybrid formats,
  - or computationally enhanced physics sequences.
- Exercises are written in a consistent **Model → Math → Conclusion → Verification** structure that can be reused or reassigned.

## Computational Tools

Python is used throughout the book as a **verification and exploration tool**, not as a replacement for analytical reasoning.  
Common libraries include:
- `numpy`
- `scipy.constants`
- `matplotlib`

On exams, students are provided with **lookup tables**, not code. The goal is conceptual understanding first, computation second.
