        "(a) A piano is lifted by a crane. The original scene is redrawn in a deliberately simplified form to emphasize the essential geometry. (b) With the simplified sketch, the relevant forces are easily identified: the rope tension $\\vec{T}$, the force exerted by the piano on the rope $\\vec{F}_T$, and the weight of the piano $\\vec{w}$. (c) Defining the piano as the system of interest removes $\\vec{F}_T$, which acts on the outside world, leaving only $\\vec{T}$ and $\\vec{w}$ in the free-body diagram (FBD). (d) When the piano is stationary, these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so $\\vec{T} = -\\vec{w}$.

        "\n",
        "Friction plays an obvious role when there is an object on a slope.  It could be a crate pushed up a ramp or a skateboarder coasting down a mountain, but the basic physics is the same.  \n",
        "\n",
        "We generalize the sloping surface and call it an inclined plane.  Recall the [**Weight on an incline**](https://saturnaxis.github.io/IntroPhysics/Chapter05/newtons-laws.html#example-problem-weight-on-an-incline) problem, where we orient our system axes so that the motion is along the $x$-axis only (i.e., flat).\n",
        "\n",
        "When an object rests on a horizontal surface, the normal force supporting it is equal in magnitude to its weight.  Additionally, simple friction is always proportional to the normal force.  However with the inclined plane, we must find the force acting on the object that is directed perpendicular to the surface (i.e., it is a *component of the weight*).\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider an object that slides down an inclined plane at *constant velocity* (i.e., the net force is zero).  Such conditions can be used to measure the coefficient of kinetic friction between two objects.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- Recall the free-body diagram from Chapter 5 ([Fig. 5.18](https://saturnaxis.github.io/IntroPhysics/Chapter05/newtons-laws.html#id1)), where we found that $w_x = w\\sin{\\theta}$ and the friction opposes the motion along the $x$-axis.  The normal force is opposing the weight along the $y$-axis, or $N = w\\cos{\\theta}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the kinetic friction on a slope is $f_k = \\mu_k N = \\mu_k mg\\cos{\\theta}$.  Writing this out in terms of forces, we have\n",

        "> Earlier, we analyzed the situation of a downhill skier moving at constant velocity to determine the coefficient of kinetic friction. Now let’s do a similar analysis to determine acceleration. The snowboarder of Figure {numref}`{number}<snowboarder-fig>` glides down a slope that is inclined at $13^\\circ$ to the horizontal. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the board and the snow is $\\mu_k = 0.20$. What is the acceleration of the snowboarder?\n",

This acceleration is smaller than the component of gravity alone ($a_{gx} = g\\sin{\\theta} = 2.2\\ {\\rm m/s^2}$) because kinetic friction opposes the motion along the slope. The result follows directly from balancing gravity and friction along the incline under the assumption of steady sliding.\n",
